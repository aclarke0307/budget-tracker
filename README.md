# Budget Tracker Starter Code

# Description
As an avid traveler, I wanted my website to have functionality ofline. Updating an existed budget tracker application, the user would  be able to add expenses and deposits to thier budget with or without connection. the offline functionality involved installing an IndexedDB, and  Service Worker. To provide users a mobile-first application, the application includes a web manifest.
